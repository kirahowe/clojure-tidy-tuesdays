"Heaven’s Wildlife Harvey is a somewhat rotund groundhog who is the official forecaster for the Heaven’s Wildlife Rescue Centre near Oil Springs, Ontario. Harvey succeeds Oil Springs Ollie, who began making predictions in 2014. “Harvey is doing great in his new role,” says Peggy Jenkins, founder of Heaven’s Wildlife Rescue. “Ollie taught him well.” However, Harvey can be a little more rambunctious: while Ollie was laid back and easy-going, Harvey is “kind of a little brat.”",heavens-wildlife-harvey,42.7669782,-82.1832562,true,Heaven’s Wildlife Harvey,Oil Springs,Groundhog,https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=100068618865920,Ontario,true,70,Harvey,https://groundhog-day.com/images/ghogs/heavens-wildlife-harvey.jpeg,https://www.theobserver.ca/news/local-news/earlier-spring-on-the-way-predicts-heavens-wildlife-harvey,3,Canada

"Pisgah Penny is a white Tree Squirrel who makes an annual prediction for “White Squirrel Day” in Brevard, North Carolina. White Squirrel Day is similar in many respects to Groundhog Day, the primary difference being the substitution of a groudhog for a squirrel. Penny’s predictions are based on what side of her display cage she moves to, one side signifying early spring and the other six more weeks winter. Brevard Mayor Maureen Copelof says “Pisgah Penny has established herself as a beloved and valued member of this community who openly asserts her love for Brevard,” while “Punxsutawney Phil has established himself as, let’s be honest, an ill tempered, unreliable predictor.”",pisgah-penny,35.243478,-82.7769959,false,Pisgah Penny,Brevard,Tree squirrel,https://www.facebook.com/whitesquirrelinstitute,North Carolina,true,73,Penny,https://groundhog-day.com/images/ghogs/pisgah-penny.jpeg,https://www.facebook.com/whitesquirrelinstitute/posts/pfbid02hPREHeeEVQ3oqguYA5NnFU77FynXyJy4b26K8e66c8uZttQJTegzgn9UwVZ8uRBnl,3,USA
