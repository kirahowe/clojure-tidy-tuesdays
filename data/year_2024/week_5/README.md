# Groundhog predictions

This week's data is in honour of Groundhog Day. [Groundhogday.com](https://groundhog-day.com/predictions) has a somewhat un-inspiring table of predictions by year, so we'll try to come up with something better. The datasets in this folder are generated from the code in [`generate_dataset.clj`](generate_dataset.clj), which is mostly a "translation" into Clojure of the [cleaning script](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/tree/master/data/2024/2024-01-30#cleaning-script) from the R4DS tidy tuesday repo, which some additional explanations.
