2024 Data

These are the datasets for #TidyTuesdays in 2024. Each week a dataset is shared, along with an article that can provide some inspiration for what to look for in the data. They are the published for the [TidyTuesday project](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/tree/master) by the [R for Data Science Online Learning Community](https://github.com/rfordatascience). There are explanations of how the data is generated in each week's `generate_dataset.clj` namespace. Any changes from the data as published by the original tidytuesday project are noted in the READMEs.
